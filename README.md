Illustration of JavaScript Callbacks vs Promises (using Q library)

After cloning the repository, run the below commands in the repo directory.
```
$ npm install
$ cd lib
```

In lib directory, there are three files

* async.js - illustrates JavaScript's asynchronous functions

* callbacks.js - illustrates callbacks

* promises.js - illustrates promises built using Q library

The files are well-commented to explain the concepts of callbacks and promises.

```
To run the files, use the below commands

$ node async.js
$ node callbacks.js
$ node promises.js
```
